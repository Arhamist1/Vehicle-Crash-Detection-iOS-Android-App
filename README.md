# CRASH & ANOMALOUS ACTIVITY DETECTION 

 RAD is a safety feature that’s
 available on a safety app helping
 to protect you and your loved
 ones. It’s able to sense when
 you’ve been in a car accident,
 either as a driver or passenger,
 and will quickly notify emergency
 services, and could also alert
 your family members. Main thing
 is to monitor the vehicle with fully
 automated system & GPS
 satellite tracker.
  
The system includes a sensor,
 sound meter, GPS and GSM
 module. The sensors will detect
 the accident & sound meters will
 trigger an alarm. The GPS will
 track location coordinates and
 the GSM will send an alert
 notification to the nearby
 hospital & police authorities.
 Thus, this system will send an
 instant alert to the nearby rescue
 team & hospital facility to notify
 them of the accident occurred for them to take immediate actions. This Application aids in
 having a better coordination and
 keeps all the concerned bodies
 and authorities informed and
 alerts them quickly which also
 saves time in rescuing an
 accident patient. When a person
 meets an accident, he is usually
 not in a condition to interact with
 an application on his phone and
 ask for help in such situation
 accident is detected
 automatically through RAD app
 based on sound reading and
 sensor reading, RAD continuously
 sense for such accidents.

## Features


 This system has great features
 which can be implemented on a
 large scale by medical: team and
 police authorities together to
 address and handle accident
 cases more efficiently. Our
 system will provide the location
 and alert the nearby  hospitals by
 detecting the impact of the
 accident through sensors. Our
 system provides an interactive
 and entertaining application for
 the Android/iOS marketplace.
